							ICU</a></strong></h5>
					<h6>
						<p>This paperâ€™s primary goal is to classify high-risk patients so they can seek more aggressive
							treatment and decrease their chance of dying.  <br>An early estimate of patient survival based on
							initial (first 24 h) test tests, chart events, and patient demographic information was
							established to accomplish this.  <br>The secondary goal of the project and classifier is to
							classify patients at lower risk who do not need to be handled as vigorously so that
							appropriate care can be received, thus lowering health costs.</p>
