						<p align="justify">The research work was an extension to my previous publication. This paper included more comprehensive analysis employing feature extraction techniques with more attributes, and even better results. This paper has employed eight classifiers over feature selection and extraction methods involving PCA, LDA, LLE, t-SNE, and Chi2 Test were used for novel preprocessed dataset files: Linear Support vector (SVM), K Nearest Neighborhood (KNN), Linear Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Boosted Trees, Regular SVM, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).

					A novel Spatio-Temporal Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis</a></strong></h5>
			<h6><strong>Authors:</strong> Dr. Ruchika Malhotra, Sarthak Aggarwal, and Ridhima Bansal</h6>
			<h6>
				<p  align="justify">The coronavirus was originated in Wuhan City in China in 2019, and it led to something for which the world was not prepared. 
					In the world where the extent of COVID’19 was ubiquitous, India was one of the countries that witnessed multiple phases of its spread. Moreover, since India has one of the largest populations, this made analyzing the sentiment of people during this time a task that held significance. 
					<br>COVID’19 brought a mix of emotions across the different periods in its first 18 months. During this time, social media was flooded with tweets and hashtags expressing both favorable and negative opinions about COVID'19, pandemic, lockdown, and vaccines.</p>

					<h6><strong>Authors:</strong> Dr. Rajni Jindal, Sarthak Aggarwal, and Saanidhi</h6>
					<h6>
						<p  align="justify">This paper’s primary goal is to classify high-risk patients so they can seek more aggressive
							treatment and decrease their chance of dying.  <br>An early estimate of patient survival based on
							initial (first 24 h) test tests, chart events, and patient demographic information was
							established to accomplish this.  <br>The secondary goal of the project and classifier is to
							classify patients at lower risk who do not need to be handled as vigorously so that
							appropriate care can be received, thus lowering health costs.</p>
