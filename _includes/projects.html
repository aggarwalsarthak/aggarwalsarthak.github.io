					Images</a></strong></h5>
					<h6>
						<p  align="justify">This project's goal was to detect COVID19 by training a self-developed and available
							deep learning models of VGG-16,
							ResNet-50, and InceptionV3 on Chest X-Ray Images.The images from the IEEE8023 X-Ray
							Dataset were classified into four
							separate classes, namely Normal, Pneumonia Bacterial, Pneumonia Viral, and COVID19.

					<h6>
						<p align="justify">This project's goal was to built a service to identify and scrub the relevant sentences of
							the
							document against a list of entities. The framework implemented coreference resolution and NER (Named Entity Recognition) to remove unwanted texts. The service was built by implementing Named Entity
							Recognition and
							Coreference Resolution.

					Derivatives Analyser</a></strong></h5>
					<h6>
						<p align="justify">Financial Derivatives Analyser is an Angular-Springboot based rest application that can
							analyze
							Futures and Options derivatives by deriving maximum possible profits/losses, breakeven
							points, and generate net payoffs graphs of the
							trades. This includes a backend layer built over the implementation of complex financial
							algorithms to calculate the different financial features.

					Farewell Web Application</a></strong></h5>
					<h6>
						<p  align="justify">2020 which brought COVID Lockdown and restrictions for the graduates, and consequently taking
							away the opportunity for the Batch of 2020 to have a farewell they deserve.  <br>
							Turning crisis into opportunity, developed a web application facilitate the farewell for
							more than
							2000 fellow students for the batch of 2020. An opportunity for students to have their
							profiles,
							share their memories with each other, voting each other for their title, putting up a
							pictures on photowall,
							etc.
							<br>This gathered a reach of around 7600 new users, along with 400k page views
							within a week from the web application's release.

						<h6>
							<p  align="justify">Microsoft- MapMyIndia Automata is an automation pipeline that uses NLP and Computer Vision to automate the task of adding a location or reporting an incident on the map across India. This information is crowdsourced in the form of text and images, and the automata verify information using text processing and leveraging cloud vision APIs. The algorithm also implements a timestamp algorithm and geotagging to check the freshness of the image. This framework achieved the operational efficiency of multiple hours to seconds, while totally eliminating the human intervention which currently persists.

							<h6>
								<p  align="justify">TAMP was a web-application based disease predictor framework that employed machine learning techniques on a labeled MIMIC III dataset, to give a prediction score of about the diseases which might follow from the inputted symptoms, along with predicting the mortality of the patients from their ICU vitals. The user could input up to 5 symptoms along with demographic details. The framework showed exceptional accuracy of 94% for the Random Forest algorithm.

								<h6>
									<p  align="justify">EVDA is an anti-collision computer vision framework to avoid mishaps (car, train accidents) that might occur due to low visibility or fog. The video captured in frames was transformed into saliency maps and was superimposed with RGB frames of the video. On these superimposed frames, the YOLO algorithm was applied to detect the object, and the type of object in order to increase the visibility. On top of this, a ZED stereo camera was used to calculate the real-time distance from the object in front, and a cumulative score was provided to detect the object and avoid the collision.</p>
